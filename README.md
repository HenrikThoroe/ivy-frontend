# Ivy - Frontend

The frontend for the `Ivy Chess Manager` project.
Provides an interface for the [backend](https://github.com/HenrikThoroe/ivy-backend).

## üéâ Motivation

The backend provides many features to manage, train and compare different chess engines.
To put good use to all these features a neat frontend is required!
The repo contains a NextJS application to access the backend and upload, download,
train and compare engines.

## üìñ Project Overview

The projects is following the NextJS 13+ `app` folder structure.
Reusable components are placed under `/components`. Logic can be found under `/lib`.

The component directory follows a fixed structure:

- Groups are named `(<name>)`
  - A group is a collection of logically related components
- Components with name `A` are saved as `A/A.tsx`.
- Each component has a coresponding `Comp.stories.ts(x?)` file
  - See [storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
  - The story is placed in the components directory
- Any logic or extracted sub-component is placed in the components directory
  - Sub components are usually implemented as nested arrow functions, but sometimes they need their own directory
  - Sub components should not be imported by other components as they only make sense in the components context
